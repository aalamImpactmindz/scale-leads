        <h3 className="color-light">What is a landing page?</h3>
        <p>
          Whether you work in marketing, sales, or product design, you
          understand the importance of a quality landing page. Landing pages are
          standalone websites used to generate leads or sales—in other words,
          they help you increase your revenue. Unlike typical web pages, landing
          pages only have one call to action, or CTA, and they are usually tied
          to a specific marketing or advertising campaign. The hyper-focused
          nature of landing pages means they come with a pretty standard set of
          best practices.
        </p>
        <h3 className="color-light">Landing pages vs. front pages</h3>
        <p>
          A typical front page or website in general includes a full navigation
          bar with tons of links throughout the page linking to other pages or
          pieces of content. A good landing page should only have one link, or
          multiple links that all point to the same thing. Having one CTA on
          your landing page increases conversions because there's less
          distraction—fewer equally appealing options to prompt your users into
          leaving your landing page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your brand's front page has totally different goals. It should show
          off your brand's personality, let people explore different features,
          find blogs and support articles, or even apply for a job. But they
          won't necessarily purchase your product from the front page. And
          that's why we need landing pages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since landing pages are tied to specific campaigns, you don't need to
          worry about users lacking information about your product. They arrived
          at your landing page because they were interested in an ad or post on
          Google, Bing, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or similar places
          on the web. With super-detailed campaigns pointing to easy-to-use
          landing pages, you're getting high-quality leads that are actually
          interested in using your product.

          Best practices for creating a landing page
        </h3>
        <p>
          What makes an easy-to-use landing page? Overall, it's clear, concise,
          and doesn't give users any options except for the main CTA. In terms
          of copy, your landing page should have one clear message. The header
          of your page should promote the desired action you want visitors to
          take and explain the benefits of performing this action.
        </p>
        <p>
          The visual design of your page should be very simple. Unlike your
          front page, this is not the place to go crazy with brand
          personality—so no wild animations or complex design elements. You
          wouldn't want to distract visitors from performing the main action of
          your page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Landing page CTAs are typically buttons, sometimes accompanied by an
          input field if you need to collect user information. To ensure your
          buttons are clicked, make sure they stand out visually. This can be
          done by contrasting the button color with your page background and
          using clear copy on the button itself. For example, if you are asking
          visitors to book a demo, write “Book a demo” clearly on the CTA
          button.
        </p>
